### Hey y'all!

Thanks for checking out my Github page. You'll find a lot of random stuff here. You'll likely see a lot of CDK projects and some DynamoDB sandbox projects. Maybe a few forks. 



Check out my repos here, like the [Nightynight](https://github.com/mbonig/nightynight), [rds-tools](https://github.com/mbonig/rds-tools), or the [sqs-redrive](https://github.com/mbonig/sqs-redrive) (sorry, that's a boring name), I'm always looking for Issues and PRs!

Also, please check out [The CDK Book](https://thecdkbook.com), [cdk.dev](https://cdk.dev) and [My Blog](https://matthewbonig.com) or follow me on Twitter [@mattbonig](https://twitter.com/mattbonig).
